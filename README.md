# Finance Plot

Finance Plotter, or finplot, is a performant library with a clean api to help you with your backtesting. It's
optionated with good defaults, so you can start doing your work without having to setup plots, colors, scales,
autoscaling, keybindings, handle panning+vertical zooming (which all non-finance libraries have problems with).
And best of all: it can show hundreds of thousands of datapoints without batting an eye.
